custom commit messages

file contains hash of file containing sha256 of pwd, that way
NOONE will be able to reverse-derive my pwd from sha1 that is
currently hard coded in src code and is exposed when I upload
it to github, plus, the fear that mere deleting of pwd file
root dir will cause loss of pwd is removed cuz now we have 2
step verification

DONE:
shreadder
manual git init
git config --local user.name "S C Prasad"
git config --local user.email "scp@example.com"
git add *
git commit -m 


DONE:
securing shell injections, search for all uses of 'shell=True'

for deleting operations
REPLACE 	del "%(
BY		os.remove(

similarly for opening file use
os.startfile()
---------------------------------
for blocked execution by subprocess.call use subprocess.Popen
